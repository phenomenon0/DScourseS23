\section{On Data and Economics}

It's safe to say I had a heightened love for economics after reading super freakonomics, apart from that I an quite interested in finances of sports clubs particularly in soccer. 
I have been interested in data science for a minute and worked as a data scientist for some time. Then I didnt do much of ML and it feels like ages anyway, one of my goals coming into this class was to get practical projects to apply skills on. And something good on my resume flexible enough for roles in sports data analytics , business intelligence and data science.

\section{Equation}
\[x^2+ y^2 = z^2 \]
